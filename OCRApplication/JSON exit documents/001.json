The LCM, of copper 0n P. gonionotus at\n24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h were estimated as 2-17, 0-91, 0-57, 0-53 and 0-42 mg l\" 1,\nrespectively. To determine the effect of copper on the immune system, ﬁsh\nwere exposed for 66 days to 0-05, 0-10 and 0-15 mg Cu l\" 1. After 56 days of\ninitial exposure to copper, fish were challenged with 0-1 ml of 4-5 >< 10\"\u2019cfu\nml 7' l formalin killed A. hydrophila and maintained in the same concentration\nof copper. After the challenge, the immune response was monitored for\n2 weeks using haematological and serological assays. During the initial phase\nof exposure to copper, signiﬁcant changes were noted in the White blood cell,\nlysozyme, potential killing activity, total plasma protein, total immunoglobu-\nlin and haematocrit levels between the control and treated ﬁsh. One week\nafter challenge with A. hydrophila, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the\nvalues of White blood cells, total protein and total immunoglobulin compared\nto the values before the challenge. However, these values were not signiﬁ-\ncantly different (P>0~05) between the control and the treated ﬁsh. In contrast,\nNBT and lysozyme assays exhibited a signiﬁcant difference (P<0-05) in ﬁsh\nexposed to 0-10 mg Cu l l (0-525i0-17; 244213-35 X 102,11mg mlil) and\n0-15 mg Cu l\"1 (0-536i0-19: 21-78i1-29 >< 102\/1mg ml 1) compared to the\ncontrol (0-746 i 0-31; 30-73 i 5-42 >< 102 pmg ml 7 1) after the bacterial challenge\n(day 61). There was however n0 signiﬁcant difference (P>0-05) in NBT and\nlysozyme levels in ﬁsh exposed to lower level of copper (0-05 mg Cu l 1),\nsuggesting the absence of immunosuppressive effects at lower level of\nexposure.
