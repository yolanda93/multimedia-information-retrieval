The natural cytotoxic activity of head—l<idney leucocytes from gilthead sea-
bream (Spams aurata L.), after in vitro and in vivo vitamin E treatment,
against tumor cells was studied by ﬂow cytometry. Leucocytes were incubated
in culture medium with different vitamin E supplementations (001%ng
ml ' 1) for 6, 24 or 48 h and the results demonstrate that all the assayed vitamin
E supplementations signiﬁcantly enhanced the natural cytotoxic activity of
leucocytes. To determine the effect of a high dietary level of vitamin E on this
activity, ﬁsh were fed with 0 (control), 600, 1200 0r 1800 mg of vitamin E
supplementation kg“ diet for 2, 4 or 6 weeks. After 2 and 4 weeks of
treatment. the natural cytotoxic activity was signiﬁcantly enhanced at the
highest (1'8 g kg "I diet) and lowest (600 mg kg "1 diet) vitamin E supplement
dosage, respectively. No effect of the vitamin E supplemented diet on sea-
bream leucocyte natural cytotoxic cellactivity was observed after 6 weeks of
treatment. l“ 2001 Academic Press

I. Introduction

Vitamin E, besides being a very important lipid-soluble micronutrient (Tu
et al., 1995), is a normal constituent of all cellular membranes, being particu-
larly abundant in immune cell membranes, where it is an essential component
for cell functioning. Furthermore, due to its antioxidant properties, vitamin E
interacts with other nutrients, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids
(Beharka et al., 1997).

The role played by vitamin E in several immunological responses has been
studied in mammals (Meydani et al., 1986; Moriguchi et al., 1990; Ndiweni
& Finch, 1995; Beharka et al., 1997) and teleosts (Cowey et al., 1981; Hung
et al., 1982; Blazer & Wolke, 1984; Hardie et al., 1990; Mulero et al., 1998;
Ortufio et al., 2000). Mammals fed vitamin E-depleted diets showed depressed
immune activities such as resistance to infection, speciﬁc antibody responses,
splenic antibody forming cells, in vitro mitogenic responses of lymphocytes,
reticuloendothelial system clearance or phagocytic index. All these immune
functions were enhanced as a consequence of a-tocopherol intake (Meydani &
